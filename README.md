# Convert-Sentences-to-Sequences

The notebook implement that how to convert the sentences to sequences. 
In order to feed sentence into recurrent neural network, we must convert a sentence to a **vector**.
In this notebook, I simply use **Tokenizer** object in keras to tokenize the sentence.

The detailed result and implementation are showed in this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/l066858998/tokenize-a-list-of-sentences).
